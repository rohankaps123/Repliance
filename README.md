# Project Overview
The working name we have for our application is Repliance, a question and answer app which draws inspiration from websites and applications such as Quora, Yahoo! Answers, and Snapchat. Repliance will allow a user to post a question and receive a specific amount of anonymous replies, after which the post will be deleted from view for everyone except the user who posted it.

Users who wish to post a question will do so by logging in and creating a new post, including detailing text. The post they make is then sent to the feed of all other users, who can choose to reply. Users replying to posts can only see their own replies; in other words, there is no public comment chain to the original post.

One feature of the app is that the amount of users the poster wishes to receive replies from is specified by the poster. For example, if the poster poses a question, they may specify to make the post unavailable to other users "after twenty responses" or some other number dictated by options available to choose from on the web app. 

As soon as this limit is reached, the post is hidden from all users except the poster, who can look through the replies they received for as long as they want and vote on the replies they received.

Every user, at the time of creation, begins with a score of 0. When they post a reply to a question, they are automatically awarded 1 point. This is to encourage users to reply to questions often. When the poster of a question views all the replies, they can vote on the answers they received. Voting an answer as a "Good Answer" will award an aditional point for the answerer, while voting it as a "Bad Answer" will remove the automatic point that was awarded, and the answerer will receive nothing. This is to encourage users to post quality answers to questions.

From the perspective of a user who is not asking a question themselves, they may scroll through questions in a feed and choose which to reply to. The number of replies needed before closing will be visible, but what others have replied to it with will not be visible. This allows for the users who originally posted questions to receive answers which they know are not influenced by what others have already said.

Questions will be sorted by most recently posted at the top.

# Original Proposal
