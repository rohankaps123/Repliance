# Project Overview
The working name we have for our application is Repliance, a question and answer app which draws inspiration from websites and applications such as Quora, Yahoo! Answers, and Snapchat. Repliance will allow a user to post a question and receive anonymous replies, after which the post will be deleted from view for everyone except the user who posted it.

Users who wish to post a question will do so by logging in and creating a new post, including text and optionally including a photo. The post they make is then sent to the inbox or feed of a certain number of other random users, who can choose to reply. Users replying to posts can only see their own replies; in other words, there is no public comment chain to the original post.

One feature of the app is that the amount of users the poster wishes to receive replies from is specified by the poster. For example, if the poster poses a question, they may specify to make the post unavailable to other users "after twenty responses" or some other number dictated by options available to choose from on the web app. This is one of two options for when a post decides to close itself off from public view.

The other option for when a post will vanish is time. A poster may pose a question, and have it set to remove itself from public view after "15 minutes", regardless of the number of replies it has.

As soon as either option completes, the post is hidden from all users except the poster, and the poster can look through the replies they received for as long as they want and see what people had to say.

From the perspective of a user who is not asking a question themselves, they may scroll through questions in a feed and choose which to reply to. The amount of time left a question has before it disappears, and the number of replies needed before closing, will be visible, but what others have replied to it with will not be visible. This allows for the users who originally posted questions to receive answers which they know are not influenced by what others have already said.

Posts will be sorted in the inbox feed by "least time left" and "least replies needed" at the top, so that shorter polls (lasting a few minutes) get replies the fastest, or posts which just need a few more answers to close will be higher priority.
