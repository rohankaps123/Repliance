##Highlights
 Continued to try and fix the add user functionality. Still hitting bugs that are causing the generation of a uid and trying to add a user cause errors. When we hardcoded the add function and set it to create it when we clicked on the account hyperlink, it worked. So the function works as it should, just not where it should and when it should. Matt updated a lot of front end stuff. He worked on the home page's look and how it resizes.
