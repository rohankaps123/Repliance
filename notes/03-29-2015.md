##Discussion Highlights

Today we finalized the details of the views from Project 03 our app will have and how we want to implement them in terms of the front and back end. During the week, Matt and Rohan will come up with updates to the wireframe images which relect what we decided to change or modify today.

We also gave a rough idea of our schema for the database tables. James and Kalina will do more research into how uplodaing images works in express/node apps and how SQL can reference text and images to associate with a question post ID number. James and Kalina will add the table schemas to a new google spreadsheet and work on this during the week.

Matt and Rohan will also learn more about Twitter Boorstrap during the week and how it will work with our app.

Today we began adding a folder in our team-rocket repo to begin updating with code we work on on our own until the next meeting.

We plan to meet again this Thursday afternoon.
