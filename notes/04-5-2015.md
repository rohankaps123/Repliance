##Discussion Highlights

Today we discussed the implementation of the various parts and how they would work in regards to querying the databases. Rohan and Kavya got a basic login page constructed. Matt, James, and I (Colin) started writing down how each view would operate and how the various functions on each would work. We talked a lot about bootstrap and CSS and the styling of the app. We started writing up the documentation for project 4 as well.
