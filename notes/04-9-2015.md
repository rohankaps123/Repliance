##Discussion Highlights

Went over how each view would operate, and how that interacts with the database tables. We also planned out how each page would look in regards to its functionality. We drew each view and discussed each field. We also talked about how jquery would work with the animations we hope to include, like expanding divs. We determined how to format the google doc and the presentation that goes along with it.
