##Discussion Highlights

We were able to just about finish up the majority of the code. Displaying the answers to your questions now works. Voting on different answers to your question now works with buttons, as well as score calculation. Each question on the main page will now expand and collapse to show more details and the reply form. Score was added to the nav bar, and the new pages were made pretty.
