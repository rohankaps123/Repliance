##Discussion Highlights

Today we continued work on database implemetations. User authentication was transitioned to the database and we refactored the route handlers into their own javascript files for their respective views, keeping users.js for authentication/login/logout/signup. We nearly finished the sign up functionality yet ended with one final bug to investigate and resolve for that feature.
