##Discussion Highlights
We made major headway in displaying the answers on the answer page, the questions of myquestions, and the open questions of other users on the home page. The next step we aim to make it answering questions on the home page. In terms of front end, reformatted the ask questions page, making it look neat and even, with a different button than the login.
