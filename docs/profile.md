## Other Courses

+ Communication 297T: This course focused on the social impact of technology with regards to security, privacy, electronic waste, automation replacing jobs, and more. My final paper for the course focused on the impact of electronic waste in Agbogbloshie, Ghana, as well as areas of China. The wider perspective I gained on things I use every day and take for granted with technology made this one of the best classes I took freshman year at UMass.

+ Communication 260: Public Speaking is one of the most useful skills to work on no matter what your profession is which is why I wanted to take Comm 260. This course helped me learn better techniques for speaking in public, and the structure of the course made it so that I could work towards my own goals of what I wanted to improve on and learn what helped me best with speaking in public.
