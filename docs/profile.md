## Other Courses

+ Communication 297T: This course focused on the social impact of technology with regards to security, privacy, electronic waste, automation replacing jobs, and more. My final paper for the course focused on the impact of electronic waste in Agbogbloshie, Ghana, as well as areas of China. The wider perspective I gained on things I use every day and take for granted with technology made this one of the best classes I took freshman year at UMass.

+ Communication 260: Public Speaking is one of the most useful skills to work on no matter what your profession is which is why I wanted to take Comm 260. This course helped me learn better techniques for speaking in public, and the structure of the course made it so that I could work towards my own goals of what I wanted to improve on and learn what helped me best with speaking in public.

## Other Courses

+ Physics 440: This course had a big impact on me because it was the first lab which required me to independently work on experiments. I was never given instructions or a procedure explaining how to do the experiments and was expected to read scientific articles that explained the apparatus. This class helped me understand what experimental research in physics is really like.

+ Physics 381: Writing in physics helped me understand how important it is to be able to clearly explain scientific concepts in writing.

## Other Courses

+ ### ANTHRO 100: Human Nature
 Studying anthropology, especially in regards to human nature, helped me to understand how a culture develops and interacts with others. It helped me appreciate the intricacies of culture.

+ ### PHIL 160: Intro to Ethics
 This class really helped me see how fluid and subjective ethics are. I had an idea of that already, but this class pushed it home. Learning about all the different outlooks and types of ethical views was really eye opening.
