### Area of Interest

#### We're interested in creating an app that will result in social and cultural connections between people. Specifically, we want to create an app through which a user can post a picture or question and ask for other users' advice. We want the posts and replies to be anonymous because we believe that users are more likely to provide genuine feedback anonymously because they would not have to worry about being associated with their responses. A post would also be removed from public view once it has generated enough comments, or has reached a time limit, which can be specified by the poster. After a post becomes unavailable to the public, the original poster would still be able to see the post and all comments it received.
For example, if you post a question through Team Rocket's app asking if you should take Math 101 at UMass and choose to have the post removed from public view after ten minutes, other users  would get a notification that a new post has been posted. They would then be able to anonymously say what they thought of Math 101 without having to feel ashamed if they struggled with the material. After ten minutes, the post and all the comments would be visible only to you and you would be able to go through them at your convenience.

My name is James Desjardin and I am a junior computer science major at UMass Amherst. I currently work two jobs on campus, as a Lead Consultant and the Student Multimedia Assistant at IT User Services, and as the Graphics Production Manager at The Massachusetts Daily Collegian.

## CS Courses Taken

+ CS 187
+ CS 220
+ CS 240
+ CS 250
+ CS 345

## Other Courses

+ Communication 297T: This course focused on the social impact of technology with regards to security, privacy, electronic waste, automation replacing jobs, and more. My final paper for the course focused on the impact of electronic waste in Agbogbloshie, Ghana, as well as areas of China. The wider perspective I gained on things I use every day and take for granted with technology made this one of the best classes I took freshman year at UMass.

+ Communication 260: Public Speaking is one of the most useful skills to work on no matter what your profession is which is why I wanted to take Comm 260. This course helped me learn better techniques for speaking in public, and the structure of the course made it so that I could work towards my own goals of what I wanted to improve on and learn what helped me best with speaking in public.

## Bio
I am a physics major minoring in both math and computer science. I will be graduating at the end of this semester and then going to graduate school for a PhD in physics. I am also originally from Bulgaria and over the summer I worked at the University of Rome in Italy!

## CS Courses Taken
+ CS 121
+ CS 187
+ CS 230
+ CS 240

## Other Courses

+ Physics 440: This course had a big impact on me because it was the first lab which required me to independently work on experiments. I was never given instructions or a procedure explaining how to do the experiments and was expected to read scientific articles that explained the apparatus. This class helped me understand what experimental research in physics is really like.

+ Physics 381: Writing in physics helped me understand how important it is to be able to clearly explain scientific concepts in writing.

## Other Courses

+ ANTHRO 100 Human Nature: Studying anthropology, especially in regards to human nature, helped me to understand how a culture develops and interacts with others. It helped me appreciate the intricacies of culture.

+ PHIL 160 Intro to Ethics: This class really helped me see how fluid and subjective ethics are. I had an idea of that already, but this class pushed it home. Learning about all the different outlooks and types of ethical views was really eye opening.
