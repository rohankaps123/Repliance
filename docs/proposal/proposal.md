###A Team Rocket Venture
 
##Meet the Team

#### James Desjardin: Back End Development, Database Development.

I am a Junior at UMass majoring in Computer Science. I have worked with HTML/CSS in the past but am interested in learning more about back-end development in this course. Last semester I took CS 345, and hope to use what I learned about SQL in that course to help with Repliance's database. I also have taken CS 220, which I hope helps me work on determining how Repliance's back-end should be structured.

##Problem Statement
####Author: Colin McGinnis 2/22/2015
Often times, we feel our friends aren't being completely truthful when we ask for advice or critiques. For example, when someone asks a friend if what they are wearing looks good, the friend may be more inclined to say yes, no matter how it actually looks. In the classes that our group has taken in the past, such as Anthropology 100 and Psychology 100, it has become clear that some of the most helpful and true advice comes from people who have a neutral view of you, who don't yet know you. Through those two classes, we've found that people are their most truthful when anonymous. 

When you don't have stock in a relationship, and a critique may not be overtly positive, it becomes easier to give that critique. What our startup hopes to do, through the skills from the CS courses we’ve taken, is create a place where people can get completely unbiased advice on the decisions they are thinking of making. CS 345 has given us knowledge of databases that we’ll use in solving the problem and classes like CS 187 and 220 have provided us with the skills to create custom data structures and utilize design strategies that will help make our app more efficient.
