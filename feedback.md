# Project: Profile

**Overall**: I like your squid logo and I appreciate that it isn’t some big pixelated mess. The formatting of the profile page was nice and clean as well. The bios need some more work though and there needs to be an idea of what you want your startup to do.


**Idea**: I’m not quite sure what you’re idea is. You need to revise this and add in what your startup is trying to really do. There’s the “area of interest” you all have, but that’s very vague. I need to be seeing an idea, not just something that encompasses a bunch of already-made products. How are you creating cultural and social connections between people? What’s missing from social networks that already exist?


**Bio**: The bios themselves could use some work for the most part. Most of y’all wrote around 3 short sentences. That’d be good for a short little tidbit in a little thumbnail, but not for an actual bio. There should be more there. Why did you choose those two 2 non-cs courses? What do you like to do for fun outside of CS? Are there any fun facts about you? Your bio should be informative, but it should also be interesting so someone can get an idea of who you are as a person. You have to think about getting an investor to like you as well—they aren’t just investing in the idea, they’re investing in you too.


**Overall Grade**: Thumbs down; add an overview to provide a better idea of the general direction for the start up. The current one-sentence ‘area of interest’ is too vague
