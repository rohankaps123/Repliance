# Project: Proposal

**Overall:** Great job! The formatting of the document was great. Your logo is nice and clean and the bios of each person are much better than last time as well! The idea seems interesting and I am curious to see how this is going to look in its implementation. 

**Idea/Problem Statement:** I think the idea is an interesting take on how to obtain advice. The problem statement was a nice illustration of some of the struggles one might have when they need advice, but might be too embarrassed to ask friends or might want an unbiased opinion. The # of replies allowed and the amount of time for a post to remain seem like the two core features of this app and they seem like the two features that make you stand out from the conventional places to ask questions/ask for advice, so just make sure you get them working as near perfect as possible.

**Timeline:** Your timeline looks good. It's nicely formatted as well.

**Funding:** Your funding costs look good as well.

**Overall Grade:** Great job this time! You've received full funding.



# Project: Profile

**Overall**: I like your squid logo and I appreciate that it isn’t some big pixelated mess. The formatting of the profile page was nice and clean as well. The bios need some more work though and there needs to be an idea of what you want your startup to do.


**Idea**: I’m not quite sure what you’re idea is. You need to revise this and add in what your startup is trying to really do. There’s the “area of interest” you all have, but that’s very vague. I need to be seeing an idea, not just something that encompasses a bunch of already-made products. How are you creating cultural and social connections between people? What’s missing from social networks that already exist?


**Bio**: The bios themselves could use some work for the most part. Most of y’all wrote around 3 short sentences. That’d be good for a short little tidbit in a little thumbnail, but not for an actual bio. There should be more there. Why did you choose those two 2 non-cs courses? What do you like to do for fun outside of CS? Are there any fun facts about you? Your bio should be informative, but it should also be interesting so someone can get an idea of who you are as a person. You have to think about getting an investor to like you as well—they aren’t just investing in the idea, they’re investing in you too.


**Overall Grade**: Thumbs down; add an overview to provide a better idea of the general direction for the start up. The current one-sentence ‘area of interest’ is too vague

**Revised:** Thumbs up. I'm happy to see additions to the areas I pointed out and much better 'area of interest' section. Great job!
