Setting up the app's database
authored by James Desjardin

For anyone who couldn't make the 4/12/15 meeting, here's how we set up the database for our app.

1.) Open a terminal window and type:

sudo -u postgres psql

2.) This should connect you as the user postgres. We now make the password of the user postgres 'postgres' because it is defined as such in our repliancedb.js connection string. You can change this file if you have a different user on your computer, however please ignore this file when committing as 

alter user postgres password 'postgres';



3.) Create the database

create database repliance owner postgres;

//to list databases

\l

//press \q to quit list of databases

//to connect to repliance database

\connect repliance

//run the instructions in schema.sql

//enter \dt to see all tables
